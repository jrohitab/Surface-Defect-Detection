AI Surface Defect Detection (Model Comparison & Evaluation)

Conducted a comparative analysis of multiple deeplearnign models to detect surface defects on metal components using image data. Preprocessed raw image datasets and models such as  Xception, ResNet0, Densenet69 and Spatial Transformers. Evaluated each model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and training efficiency.

- Selected optimal model based on 89% test accuracy with strong generalization.
- Used Python libraries such as Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for modeling, data handling, and visualization.
- Documented findings and performance metrics in a structured format to simulate industrial defect detection pipelines.

Technologies: Python, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
